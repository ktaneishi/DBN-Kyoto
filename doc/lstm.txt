LSTM Network for Sentiment Analysis
**********************************************

Summary
+++++++

This tutorial aims to provide an example of how a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture can be implemented using Theano. In this tutorial, this model is used to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the `Large Movie Review Dataset <http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/>`_, sometimes known as the IMDB dataset. 

In this task, given a movie review, the model attempts to predict whether it is positive or negative. This is a binary classification task.

Code
====

The LSTM implementation can be found in the two following files :

* `lstm.py <http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/code/lstm.py>`_ : Main script. Defines and train the model.

* `imdb.py <http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/code/imdb.py>`_ : Secondary script. Handles the loading and preprocessing of the IMDB dataset.

Data
====

As previously mentionned, the provided scripts are used to train a LSTM
recurrent neural on the Large Movie Review Dataset dataset.

While the dataset is public, in this tutorial we provide a copy of the dataset
that has previously been preprocessed according to the needs of this LSTM
implementation. You can download this preprocessed version of the dataset
using the script `download.sh <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lisa-lab/DeepLearningTutorials/master/data/download.sh>`_ and uncompress it.

Running the Code
++++++++++++++++

After downloading both the scripts, downloading and uncompressing the data and
putting all those files in the same folder, the user can run the code by
calling:

.. code-block:: bash

    THEANO_FLAGS="floatX=float32" python train_lstm.py
