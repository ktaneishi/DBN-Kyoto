A drug discovery workload using DBN model developed by Kyoto University. 
This algorithm is used to predict if the chemical structure of a compound
can interact with the protein sequence. Deep learning neural network can
resolve the bottleneck of exponential increase in the calculation time
and memory consumption encountered in SVM algorithm. 
Haswell-EP system can support 10s larger dataset than GPGPU solution due
to the huge supported memory capacity.

NOTE:
    please download dataset for DBN-Kyoto from Dropbox via below link:
        https://www.dropbox.com/s/ocjgzonmxpmerry/dataset1.pkl.7z?dl=0

    <tools> folder contains some necessary tools required by this workload.
    You can umcompress and install tools from the tar balls or install them
    via apt-get/yum install command in Ubuntu/CentOS.

Run the workload:
    1. Download the dataset files from Dropbox listed in "NOTE"
    2. Uncompress the dataset.pkl into DBN-Kyoto directory
    3. execute below command to run the workload
        python DBN_benchmark.py dataset1.pkl 2000 3
